## Testing Steps
Step 1: Trigger a call using /api/call
- Should initiate a call and read the medication reminder

Step 2: Simulate unanswered call
- Call status should update to no-answer
- Should attempt to leave voicemail
- If voicemail fails â†’ SMS should be sent

Step 3: Simulate patient-initiated call
- Patient call should trigger /api/incoming-call
- Should respond with predefined TTS message

Step 4: Verify MongoDB logs
- Check callLogs in MongoDB
- Confirm that call details and transcription are stored
